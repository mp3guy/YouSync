YouSync
=======

Something to manage YouTube playlist synchronisation. 

You need to have your client\_secrets.json file in the root directory to run it, see (this)[https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_oauth#acquiring]. You need avconv too.

Also

sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl
sudo pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
sudo easy_install --upgrade oauth2client
